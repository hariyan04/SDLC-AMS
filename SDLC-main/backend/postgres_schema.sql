The engineer sets the traceability policy once; the agent applies it continuously without prompting.'),
(10,'Requirements','Requirements','Effort, Cost & Risk Simulation','extent','To what extent is the following true in your current practice: The agent monitors cost and risk continuously against thresholds the team has set, and alerts automatically when they are breached. Humans are not periodically reviewing a spreadsheet - the system comes to them.'),

The engineer validates the output - they do not do the tracing themselves.'),

An engineer directing AI to produce a diagram, then refining it, is the standard workflow - not an engineer drawing from scratch.'),
(21,'Architecture','Architecture','Automated Drift Remediation','extent','To what extent is the following true in your current practice: Low-risk drift is remediated and shipped automatically when tests pass and the change meets defined guardrails. Humans are only pulled in when the drift is high-risk or the guardrails cannot classify it. Humans set the guardrails - the agent enforces them.'),

If a human must read every PR to catch drift, the gate is not real.'),
(24,'Architecture','Architecture','Extract Architecture from Code','extent','To what extent is the following true in your current practice: AI reads the codebase and generates architecture documentation and component maps. Engineers do not draw diagrams from memory - they review and correct AI-generated output. Critically, the AI can see the actual codebase, not just generic knowledge.'),
(25,'Architecture','Architecture','FinOps Modeller & Planner','extent','To what extent is the following true in your current practice: The agent flags architecture cost implications and overspend automatically against thresholds the team has set.

(52,'Development','Development','AI-Assisted Code Review','extent','To what extent is the following true in your current practice: AI participates in every code review, flagging bugs and security issues. A human reads every flag and makes the final call - the AI accelerates the reviewer, it does not replace the human gate.'),
(53,'Development','Development','Custom Agents via MCP & Scripts','extent','To what extent is the following true in your current practice: An agent can open a pull request on its own without a human writing the change by hand. The human''s role is to review and approve the PR - not to author the code. This is the line between L1 and L2.'),
(54,'Development','Development','Custom Instructions & Skills','extent','To what extent is the following true in your current practice: AI can see the team''s own codebase, standards, and project context - not just generic public knowledge. Custom instructions or skills are in place so the agent is project-aware by default, not by the engineer pasting context manually each time.'),
(55,'Development','Development','Long-Running Agentic Tasks','extent','To what extent is the following true in your current practice: Agents operate autonomously over extended periods. The safety net - automated rollback, fast catch-and-undo - is what makes this level achievable. If a wrong agent action cannot be caught and reversed quickly, the team cannot safely operate here.'),
(56,'Development','Development','Orchestrator & Sub-Agent Architecture','extent','To what extent is the following true in your current practice: Complex tasks are handled by orchestrated multi-agent systems that plug into a shared internal platform - not individual engineers wiring up their own tools.

Non-functional regressions are caught automatically - a human does not spot them in a periodic performance review.'),
(97,'Testing','Testing','Offline Evaluation of AI Features','extent','To what extent is the following true in your current practice: For any feature with an AI component, the agent runs structured evals against a golden dataset before code ships. The human sets the golden dataset and pass threshold once; the agent enforces it on every change.'),

A human does not curate or maintain test datasets manually - the agent produces them on demand.'),

The engineer reviews and triggers deployment - they do not write deployment config from scratch.'),
(105,'Deployment','CD / CI-CD','Initial Triage Assistance','extent','To what extent is the following true in your current practice: When something breaks in production, a system notices and surfaces probable causes before an engineer manually investigates. If an engineer is always the first to notice an incident, this practice is not Achieved.'),
(106,'Deployment','CD / CI-CD','Root Cause Analysis (RCA)','extent','To what extent is the following true in your current practice: When something breaks, a system triages it and produces a structured RCA before a human investigates.

Humans are pulled in only for ambiguous or high-risk incidents.'),
(109,'Deployment','CI / CI-CD','AI-Integrated Quality Gates','extent','To what extent is the following true in your current practice: AI quality checks - linting, security scanning, coverage - run automatically on every commit. A human reads the results and decides whether to proceed. The checks run themselves; the human is still the gate.'),
(110,'Deployment','CI / CI-CD','Agents Integrated in CI via API','extent','To what extent is the following true in your current practice: AI agents run as first-class CI pipeline steps via API, performing analysis and validation as part of the automated build. The agent acts in the pipeline; a human reviews output before merge.'),
(111,'Deployment','CI / CI-CD','Code Quality, AI Slop & Data Lineage Reporting','extent','To what extent is the following true in your current practice: The system blocks quality regressions and low-quality AI-generated code automatically on every pipeline run. A human does not periodically audit for code quality - the gate is always on.'),
(112,'Deployment','CI / CI-CD','OSS, Deprecated Code & Evergreening Scans','extent','To what extent is the following true in your current practice: Low-risk dependency updates and evergreening PRs ship automatically within guardrails the team has set. A human does not review every maintenance PR - the system handles routine updates and escalates only non-routine ones.'),
